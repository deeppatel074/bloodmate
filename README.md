## Introduction:
The purpose of this website is to help students interact and socialize with each 
other. With the help of our website students can interact with other students 
who are currently enrolled in Stevens Institute of Technology. The main focus 
is to create a network that can better facilitate information between students 
and also allow students to reach out to people outside their immediate circle.
By using our website, we provide two major services in the form of tabs. One is 
Event Management, where students can view all the current events that have 
been created by other students and can also register for the same. The other 
tab provides a discussion forum wherein students can discuss any of their 
queries.
